                    <p>Welcome to my personal website! Im an aspiring web developer that loves the outdoors, reading, watching shows and playing video games! I was born and raised in the small town of Monroe, North Carolina. I am currently a student working towards a computer science degree, Im well known for my positive atitude and I find great interest in learning new skills and determined to reach my goals. </p>
                    <h3>My hobbies</h3>
                    <p>I find that I love hiking in the mountains and recently started rock climbing! The last of us is my favorite game of all time and made me fall in love with the guitar which Ive been playing for 2 years. I love to read, draw, and Im also learning to 3D model through an application called Blender. My favorite type of movies are A24 and Studio Ghibli movies.</p>
                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p>I have a wide range of music so I cant pick a specific genre! So instead I compiled a playlist of what I listen to while im working.</p>
